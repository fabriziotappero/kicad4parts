This repository contains various *KiCad* designs of mechanical parts. 

Why use KiCad for mechanical parts? Well because in this way you can use the great
PCB fabrication process and get what your design in just few days.

Most of my stuff are ordered to [PCB WAY](https://www.pcbway.com) where shipping is about $15.

## SIRUI VH-10 Plate
This is a design of a plate for the great Sirui monopod VH-10. This plate adapts the original head with the great ArcSwill attachment.
